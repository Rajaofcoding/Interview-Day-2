    <h1> Interview Day 2</h1>
    <h4> Question: Difference between HTML tags and elements </h4>
    <p><pre>
          Ans: In HTML, tags represent the structural components of a document, 
               such as <h5> for headings. Elements are formed by tags and encompass both the opening and closing tags along with the content.
               HTML Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever is written inside < and > are called tags.
               Example:  In this example <b> is the starting tag and </b> is the ending tag.
               The HTML element consists of both the opening and closing tags as well as what’s inside those tags. 

               Example: In this example <b> is the starting tag and </b> is the ending tag but with content inside it.</pre></p>


    <h3> Question: Explain br tags
    </h3>
    <p>
        <pre> Ans: The br tag is a self-closing element, meaning it doesn’t require a closing tag.
      web browsers don’t automatically recognize new lines or paragraph formatting. This is where the br tag comes into play. </pre>
    </p>

    <h3> Question: Explain how many different types of lists we have in html 
    </h3>
    <p><pre> There are 2 types of lists in html that we use to list items
        These are the following lists
        1. Ordered list ( An ordered list starts with the <b> < ol > </ol></b>  tag. Each list item starts with the <b> < li > </b> tag.)
        2. Unordered list ( An unordered list starts with the <b> < ul > </ol></b>  tag. Each list item starts with the <b> < li > </b> tag.)
       
    </pre></p>
    <br>
    <h3> Question: What are semantic tags
    </h3>
    <p>
        <pre> Ans: Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. 
      For example, tags like header tag, article tag, and footer tag are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. </pre>
